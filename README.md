# luxa

> luxa is a [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) based CSS framework.

Simple and focused, its goal is to provide a lightweight solution that can be easily implemented in any development context.

With simple class names like `.lx-btn` or `.lx-row`, and a simple modifier system, like `.is-large`.

### Quick install

This project needs [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), as we use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

Make sure you installed it with the following commands:

```sh
node --version
```

```sh
npm --version
```

```sh
npx --version
```

#### Install the Gulp command line utility

You can install it following the [Gulp installation tutorial](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start), or you can simply run the command on your terminal:

```sh
npm install gulp gulp-cli node-sass gulp-sass --save-dev
```

Now all you have to do is initialize it:

```sh
npm run gulp
```

And you're ready! :ok_hand::grin:
