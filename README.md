### How to contribute

If you want to help, there are many ways to do it! Start by reading the [contribution guide](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/blob/master/contributing.md).

### Quick Start

This project needs [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), as we use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

Make sure you installed it with the following commands:

```sh
node --version
```

```sh
npm --version
```

```sh
npx --version
```

If they are not installed, follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

#### Install the Gulp command line utility

You can install it following the [Gulp installation tutorial](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start), or you can simply run the command on your terminal:

```sh
npm install gulp gulp-cli node-sass gulp-sass --save-dev
```

#### Verify your Gulp versions

```sh
gulp --version
```
#### Test it

Now all you have to do is initialize it:

```sh
npm run gulp
```

And you're ready! :ok_hand::grin:
